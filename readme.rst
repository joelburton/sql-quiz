SQL Quiz
========

WIP.


Todo
----

- Finish main app

- Figure out a nice way to deal with annoying colorization of headers

- Subclass to get "open quiz" (ie, they can see answers) and "closed quiz" (no answers).
  Obviously, for closed quiz, we'll need a way for it to have the expected output in the
  json on load, rather than the sql that can created the expected output.
